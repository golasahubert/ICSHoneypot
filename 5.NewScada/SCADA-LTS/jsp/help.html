            Below is a general overview of how this application works, and
            design concepts that users should know. Helpful details can be found
            throughout the application using contextual help, indicated by the
            help icon (<img src="assets/images/help-icon.png" style="width: 2%;" />). Click on this icon
            wherever it appears to get more information on the feature you are
            using.
        </p>

        <h1>Application overview</h1>
        <p>
            Functionality in this application is primarily accessed using the
            controls in the header. Depending on the permissions granted to your
            user account, you will see various icons underneath the application
            logo. When you hover over these icons with your mouse, you will see
            an overlay message with a short description of what the icon is for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beside the header controls at the right-hand side of the header is
            the username of the user who is currently logged in.
        </p>
        <p>
            When your application has an active alarm, you will see a flashing
            flag icon (<img src="images/flag_white.png" />) and an associated
            description near the center of the header area. The colour of the
            icon will indicate the severity of the alarm:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li><img src="images/flag_blue.png" /> Information</li>
            <li><img src="images/flag_yellow.png" /> Urgent</li>
            <li><img src="images/flag_orange.png" /> Critical</li>
            <li><img src="images/flag_red.png" /> Life safety</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can click on the icon or the description to go to the list of
            active alarms.
        </p>

        <h1>Data types</h1>
        <p>There are five supported data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Binary</b> (aka boolean) values have only two states,
                referred to in the system as the <b>zero</b> value and the
                <b>one</b> value. You can use a text renderer to convert the
                display of binary values to whatever alternate labels you need,
                such as "on/off", "high/low", "started/stopped", etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Multistate</b> values have multiple distinct states.
                (Strictly speaking, the binary type is a special case of a
                multistate.) Values are primitively represented as integers
                (e.g. 0, 1, 2, 7, ...), but, like binary values, you can use a
                text renderer to convert these values to appropriate text
                representations such as "on/off/disabled", "cool/heat/off", or
                anything else.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Numeric</b> (aka analog) values are decimal values
                represented in the system with a floating point variable.
                Temperature, humidity, price, and altitude are examples of
                numeric values. Text renderers can be used to determine display
                features like how many decimals places to display, whether to
                separate thousands (with commas or dots), and whether a suffix
                should be displayed (e.g. &deg;F, kW/h, moles, etc). Range
                renderers can be used to convert ranges of numeric values into
                text labels.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alphanumeric</b> values are simply strings of characters,
                such as the O/S description of an SNMP source.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Image</b> values are binary representations of image data.
                They are stored in files on the host file system (i.e. not in
                the database) and are cached in memory as necessary for
                performance purposes. Renderers can be used to create scaled
                images - such as thumbnails - for presentation.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Data sources</h1>
        <p>
            Data sources are fundamental to the operation of this application. A
            <b>data source</b> is a "place" from which data is received.
            Virtually anything can be a data source, insofar as the
            communications protocol is supported by the application. Here are
            some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you have a Modbus network accessible via RS232, RS485,
                TCP/IP, or UDP/IP, you can create a Modbus data source that will
                poll the network for data on an interval you can define.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have equipment or an application that can send data over
                HTTP you can start an HTTP receiver data source that will listen
                for incoming connections and route the data to the appropriate
                points.
            </li>
            <li>
                For hardware that supports SNMP, start an SNMP data source.
                Values can be polled on an interval schedule, or traps can be
                received for report-on-exception.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data can be read and updated in a SQL data base external to the
                system.
            </li>
            <li>
                Data can be generated either randomly or predictively using a
                Virtual data source.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data values that are received or collected by a data source are
            stored within data points.
        </p>

        <h1>Data points</h1>
        <p>
            A <b>data point</b> is a collection of associated historical values.
            For example, a particular point might be a temperature reading from
            a room, while another point could be the humidity reading from the
            same room. Points can also be control values, such as a switch to
            turn a piece of equipment on or off.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many attributes that are used to control the behaviour of
            points. Primarily, there is the concept of a <b>point locator</b>.
            Locators are used by data source to determine how to "find" the data
            for the particular point. For instance, a SQL data source has
            attributes including where to find the database instance; point
            locators for the data source indicate the table and field names with
            which to find specific values. The logical separation of data source
            and data point attributes depends on the communication protocol in
            question.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data points attributes also determine many other aspects of the
            point, such as its name, how it should be logged (all data, changes
            in value only, or not at all), how long to keep logged data, how to
            format values for display, and how to chart values.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also configure data points with <b>event detectors</b>,
            which are used to detect conditions of interest in the point's
            values (eg. value has been too high for too long, is too low,
            changes too often, doesn't change at all, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            Points can be arranged into a hierarchy, or tree, to simplify
            management and display by using the Point Hierarchy functionality.
        </p>

        <h1>Monitoring</h1>
        <p>
            Monitoring of points within the system can be done in two ways. You
            can use the <b>watch list</b> to dynamically create tabular lists of
            points including their values, last update times, and charts of
            historical information (if the point is configured to support this).
            Values and charts are updated in real time without having to refresh
            your browser window. Charts of multiple points can also be displayed
            on demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also create <b>graphical views</b> of points using drag and
            drop functionality to position graphical representations of points
            on an arbitrary background image. Animated images can be used to
            create highly dynamic visualization of system behaviour, and, like
            the watch lists, values are updated in real time without a browser
            refresh. These views can subsequently be marked as "public", so that
            they can be reused on public web sites.
        </p>

        <h1>Control</h1>
        <p>
            Control of external systems can also be acheived for points that can
            be set (aka writable or output). A <b>settable</b> point can be set
            to a user-defined value, such as a thermostat setting or equipment
            control switch. Both watch lists and graphical views provide simple
            means by which to input a value to set. The point locator for the
            settable point determines how the data source sets the value within
            the external equipment.
        </p>

        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>
            An <b>event</b> is the occurance of a defined condition within the
            system. Both system-defined and user-defined events are available.
            System-defined events include data source operation errors, user
            logins, and system startup/shutdown. User-defined events include
            point event detectors (see "event detectors" above), scheduled
            events, and compound events which detect conditions over multiple
            points using logical statements. There are also "audit events",
            which are raised when users make changes (additions, modifications,
            deletions) to runtime-affecting objects including data sources, data
            points, point event detectors, scheduled events, compound event
            detectors, and event handlers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once an event has been detected, it is acted upon by handlers. An
            <b>event handler</b> is a user-defined behaviour that is to be
            performed upon the raising of a particular event, such as sending an
            email or setting the value of a settable point.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h1>Alarm sounds</h1>
        <p>
            Scada application can play sounds when alarms are active. By default, alarm
            sounds are played for urgent, critical, and life safety alarms (i.e.
            not for information alarms).
